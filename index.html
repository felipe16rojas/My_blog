    <h2>🛫 My Travel Experience</h2>
    <p>Last month, I had the opportunity to travel from my small town, <b>Maito</b>, to the wonderful city of <b>Pereira</b>. I took a flight and made a layover in <b>Neiva</b> before reaching my final destination. The journey was comfortable, and during the flight, I looked out of the window and admired the beautiful mountains of Colombia. When I finally landed in Pereira, I felt very excited and ready to explore the city and its culture.</p>
